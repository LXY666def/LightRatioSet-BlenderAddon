# LightRatioSet-BlenderAddon
This is a Blender Addon which introduce the concept of "light ratio" to Blender, and you can quickly create the light group and set certain light ratio to achieve great lighting effect. However, this addon is not perfect now and I'm working to improve it. Thanks every user and advisor.

Also, I really hope that if some of you guys are checking my file and you are familiar with the Blender Addon Developement, you are free and welcome to improve this file. 'cause this addon is not what I designed originally, I could just realize some parts of its functions. You can find the originally designed picture of this addon in the file, hopefully you may mend it.
